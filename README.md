## Related Work

This repository extends our prior work:
- [multistakeholder-archives-recsys](https://github.com/atzenhofer/multistakeholder-archives-recsys) — RecSys 2025 short paper on multistakeholder value identification in digital archives

## Repository Contents

This repository includes interview materials from multistakeholder focus groups and computational artifacts demonstrating the proposed metrics.

### Interview Materials

- **[`appendix-stakeholders.md`](appendix-stakeholders.md)**: Anonymized profiles of 25 domain experts across five stakeholder groups (upstream, provider, system, consumer, downstream), including roles, expertise, career stage, and region.
- **[`appendix-presentation.md`](appendix-presentation.md)**: Discussion scenarios, questions, and stakeholder-specific provocative statements used in focus groups.
- **[`appendix-q&a.md`](appendix-q&a.md)**: Background materials and five-category value framework/codebook shared with participants prior to sessions.
- **[`appendix-consent-form.md`](appendix-consent-form.md)**: Consent procedures and data protection information template.
- **[`appendix-focus-groups.md`](appendix-focus-groups.md)**: Session structure and methodology overview.

Full transcripts cannot be shared due to privacy commitments.

### Computational Artifacts

- **[`toy-example-calculations/`](toy-example-calculations/)**: Python implementation of all metrics from the paper's illustrative example, demonstrating that the proposed metrics are computable and discriminate between recommendation strategies. See the [toy example README](toy-example-calculations/README.md) for usage details.

## Study Overview

We conducted structured focus groups with 25 domain experts across five stakeholder groups to understand how diverse values might inform recommender system evaluation in digital archives:

| Group | Role Examples |
|-------|---------------|
| **Upstream** (U1-U5) | Archive directors, digital curators, library research heads |
| **Provider** (P1-P5) | IT managers, archival specialists, data integration experts |
| **System** (S1-S5) | Core developers, system directors, information retrieval specialists |
| **Consumer** (C1-C5) | Senior researchers, doctoral students, educators |
| **Downstream** (D1-D5) | History professors, project editors, platform coordinators |

**Sessions**: Five 60-minute structured focus groups with scenario-based discussions on visibility, adaptation, and transparency.

**Value Framework**: Five categories (functional, user experience, responsibility, human/social, technical) shared with participants beforehand.

**Analysis**: Abductive coding approach combining deductive value categories with inductive pattern recognition, revealing tensions and convergences across stakeholder groups.

## Additional Information

**Computational Reproducibility**: The toy example calculations use fixed data and deterministic algorithms. Running `python3 main.py` in the toy-example-calculations directory will reproduce the metric values presented in the paper.

**Limitations**: This repository provides methodological transparency for the focus group study. Full interview transcripts cannot be shared to protect participant privacy as agreed in the consent process.
